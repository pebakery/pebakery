     * Be careful with paths when using this APis, MSDN also states that:
     *   If the lpFileName parameter does not contain a full path and file name for the file, WritePrivateProfileString searches the Windows directory for the file.
     *   If the file does not exist, this function creates the file in the Windows directory.
     *   If lpFileName contains a full path and file name and the file does not exist, WritePrivateProfileString creates the file.
     *   The specified directory must already exist.
     *   
     * When null is given to lpAppName, 
     *   If no section name matches the string pointed to by the lpAppName parameter,
     *   WritePrivateProfileSection creates the section at the end of the specified initialization file 
     *   and initializes the new section with the specified key name and value pairs.
